# Personal Finance AI Platform

This repository contains a collaborative project developed as part of the  
**SMU – Modern Software Solution Development** course.

## Project Overview
The Personal Finance AI Platform allows users to:
- Import monthly credit card statements (PDF/CSV)
- Consolidate expenses across multiple banks and cards
- Automatically categorize transactions
- Detect anomalous or unusual spending
- Generate AI-driven insights, budgets, and goals

## Key Constraint
Due to the lack of public consumer APIs from most Singapore banks, credit card
statements are imported through secure manual upload workflows.

## Planned Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- AI Services: LLM-based insight generation
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Deployment: Public cloud
